1. Introduction 
 
 Purpose 
 
In today's Sri Lanka, the operation of crematoria stands out as a significant issue in the wider 
context of cemetery maintenance. Addressing this issue aims to alleviate challenges arising from 
problematic crematorium bookings and subsequent difficulty in finding alternatives. Moreover, it 
aims to reduce reliance on manual systems, which create significant obstacles for local councils 
responsible for managing these operations efficiently. 
 
 Intended Audience 
 
The intended audience for Eterna Care includes municipal authorities, relevant agencies involved 
in end-of-life services, and grieving families across Sri Lanka. Municipal authorities are key 
stakeholders who will benefit from a streamlined crematorium booking process and improved 
management capabilities. Eterna Care's facilities are also suitable for relevant agencies 
responsible for issuing death certificates and accessing critical post-mortem information. Finally, 
bereaved families who seek efficient and compassionate support during end-of-life rites will be 
the ultimate beneficiaries of the system. 
 

 Project Scope 
 
Eterna Care's project scope includes the development and implementation of an online system 
tailored to address the challenges associated with cremation operations in Sri Lanka. Specifically, 
the scope includes: 
• Design and deployment of a user-friendly digital platform to streamline the 
crematorium booking process. 
• Provide transparency in the availability of crematoria across the city to empower 
municipal authorities to manage cremation requests efficiently. 
• Facilitate seamless referrals to alternative crematoriums in the event of booking 
conflicts. 
• Integrate functionality beyond reservation management, such as expediting the 
issuance of death certificates and accessing critical post-mortem information. 
• Ensuring that the system is accessible and easy to use for municipal authorities, 
relevant institutions, and affected families.
